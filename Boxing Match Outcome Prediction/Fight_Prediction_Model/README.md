# How To Use:


Data Preparation: Combine and clean the data from both datasets, ensuring we have relevant features that can be used for predicting match outcomes.

Feature Engineering: Create new features that might be predictive of match outcomes, such as win ratios, average punches landed, etc.

Data Analysis: Analyze the data to understand patterns and correlations that could be useful in prediction.

Model Selection and Training: Choose a suitable machine learning model and train it with the prepared data.

Validation and Testing: Test the model's performance using a part of the dataset not used in training (validation data).
