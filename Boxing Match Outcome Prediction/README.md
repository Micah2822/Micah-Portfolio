# About

This model represents a fusion between two passions: the art of boxing and the science of predictive modelling. It is designed to analyze the historical performance data of boxers and predict the outcome of their matches. By feeding the model with various statistics and performance metrics of fighters, it assesses and predicts who is more likely to emerge victorious in a given matchup.

The motivation behind this project was not just to indulge my curiosity, but also to explore how data analytics can enhance our understanding of sports performances. The model employs a neural network to dissect and interpret complex patterns within the data, offering insights that might not be immediately apparent even to seasoned boxing fans.
